# Project ACT
Here I will be making my script / simple server to show AC Transit times near my house. This will use the [AC Transit API](https://api.actransit.org/transit/) to pull live reports from their servers
Upcoming ideas are:
- Pull data from the 4 lines I use the most and create advanced predictions from a simple neural net model
- Export in UI readable format
